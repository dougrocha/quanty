# A MORE Streamline TODO List

Things in here I hope to actually get completed in the next few weeks.

Our notion has more of the TODO list items if not in here.

## Normal TODO PAGE

[TODO Page on Notion](https://www.notion.so/aac2d6e601874671a7fcc5756e6cf5e2?v=f73df2ea18eb4a1e88fcfd121d65343d)

### FOR ALL TODO LIST ITEMS

- [ ] Make language server with i18n support

### Random Idea Todo List

#### Docs

- [ ] Make a new Home Page for Docs App

#### Dashboard

- [ ] Finish plugin support with bot
- [ ] Analytics for dashboard with next plausible

- [ ] Having Quanty Mascot hover over premium feature switch

#### Server

- [ ] Make an end point to interact with Discord's new Auto Moderation Feature [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation)

#### Quanty Bot Framework

Gonna copy some ideas from other frameworks - [sapphirejs](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/)

- [ ] Try to incorporate new Slash Command Builder for usability and readability

- [ ] Allow users to add preconditions, similar to to verify but class [link](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/docs/Guide/preconditions/creating-your-own-preconditions)

- [ ] Add select functions/values for usability - Ex. Time class - `Time.Second * 10` = 10 seconds. Allow for webhooks to send cron jobs for specific plugins such as a birthday plugin.

- [ ] Migrate to a similar api to Discord.Js - Use more enums to allow easy migrations to newer updates

- [ ] Find some way to reduce the clutter caused by the decorators especially in the events class writing I am not a fan of writing 'ready' twice. Also find a way to infer types in the run parameters, currently it only tells you if you have the wrong types but wont auto do it.

- [ ] Add default error event handlers. This is a good idea to have as it will help with debugging and will help with the error handling.

- [ ] Add easier support for new interaction handlers
  1. Auto Complete
  2. Buttons
  3. Select Menus
  4. Modals
  5. Message Components

#### Bot

- [ ] Make a lofi command with lofi girl youtube stream
- [ ] Make a guildConfig cache manager with a webhook to auto update and have a cache of maybe 5 minutes
