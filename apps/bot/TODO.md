# TODO List for Quanty Bot

- [ ] Once new version is ready. Make a command to reset the bot's state so that it can only be changed by the bot masters on the website.

- [ ] Normalize Quanty Framework

At the moment the framework has great features and it works well. But I feel as if the features I implemented have been to opinionated towards my specific use case with the bot. Although good additions. I sense that other users may have a stability issue when it comes to using certain feature either due to lack of documentation or lack of experience myself.
